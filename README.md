Welcome to learnB4SS!

This is the workshopâ€™s **starter kit** to help you get set up without
hassle.

For more info on the workshop, check out the workshopâ€™s
[website](https://learnb4ss.github.io) and the [learning
materials](https://learnb4ss.github.io/learnB4SS/index.html).

## Prerequisite

It is essential that you went through the installation of brms and its
dependencies before downloading this kit.

If you have not installed brms yet, you can follow the instructions for
your system here: [How to install brms and
dependecies](https://learnb4ss.github.io/learnB4SS/articles/install-brms.html).

## Use the kit

After downloading and unzipping the kit, double-click on the file called
`learnB4SS-kit.Rproj`.

RStudio will start and load the project.

If [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org) is not installed on your system,
install it first:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

You might be asked to update existing packages. If so, type your answer
in the RStudio console.

Now, install the learnB4SS package with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("learnB4SS/learnB4SS", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

You might be asked to update existing packages. If so, type your answer
in the RStudio console.

Several package dependencies will be installed too.

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Finally, attach the learB4SS package! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

``` r
library(learnB4SS)
```

## Use the learnB4SS package

Now you can use the function `open_slides()` to open the session slides
in your browser and `open_exercise()` to open the exercise files.

``` r
# Open slides of session 00
open_slides(00)

# Open exercise of session 03
open_exercise(03)
```

We will use the `polite` data throughout the workshop.

You can load the data with:

``` r
data("polite")

# Learn about the data
?polite
```
